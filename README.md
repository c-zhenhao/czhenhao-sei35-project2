## Why

This is the second project after 2 instructional weeks (7 Mar - 18 Mar) on how to use React amd 1 project development week (21 Mar - 25 Mar) at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive programme (GA-SEI).

## Technologies

- The app essentially uses `React`'s basic create-react-app. Everything else was done with `JS` & `CSS`
- Used `react-router-dom v6` for the page navigation
- Used `axios` to retrieve API requests

## Introduction

My MVP was to deliver a cocktail recipe search app. For example, if a user would like to look for how to make "Gin and Tonic", the app should be able to show what are the ingredients necessary (gin, tonic, optional: lime) and instructions (pour all into glass).

## Interesting points & project post-mortems

- As there was a need to pass multiple information and further display it in a modal, the react app got complicated very quickly (which I have yet organise them...)

  - Virtual DOM looks kind of like this:
  - ![project2_virtualDom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16322250/160202279-23fe78cd-2122-4bf4-abd6-c02302d1ebde.png)

- React hooks that are "not-important-to-syllabus" functions such as `useReducer` & `useContext` in combination was actually quite useful and simplified problems of passing information from one child node. The concept of propping information lifting states still key to React and is used.

  - Creating a "global" function since multiple things need to be done inside a modal. Storing the information in a "global" state was also pretty useful, it acted like a virutal store room, which was great!

- Realised that Object destructruing was a key concept behind React & JS

## Future roadmap

0. ~~Organise the folders~~ _done 27 mar_
1. Create the modal for Discover drinks. The [cocktail API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=Gin) doesnt actually return the full drink information when searching by ingredients, but does have the drink ID.

   1. need to find a way to link them by ID

2. Refactor code - especially the modals
3. Material UI - look into improving the look & feel so it looks like an actual app
